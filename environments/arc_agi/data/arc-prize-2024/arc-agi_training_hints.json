From each of those bottom‑row dots draw a straight line that goes **up** and **to the right**, one step at a time, until the line hits the top edge or the right edge of the square.  \n6. Colour every square of that line with the dot’s colour.  \n7. Leave every other square the background colour.\n\n```\nBefore (a short row)          After (big square)\n\n0 0 2 0 0                     0 0 0 0 0\n                             0 0 0 0 0\n                             0 0 0 0 2   ← start of the line at bottom row,\n                             0 0 0 2 0   ← then move up‑right one step,\n                             0 0 2 0 0   ← keep moving until the edge\n```\n\n**Application Strategy:**\n**Step 1 – Find the coloured cells in the input row**  \n- LOOK at the 1 × 5 grid and note every position whose value is not 0.  \n- RECORD each position’s column index *c* and its colour *v*.\n\n**Step 2 – Compute the size of the output square**  \n- COUNT how many coloured cells you found → *k*.  \n- SET the side length *N* = 5 × *k* (the input length times the count).  \n\n**Step 3 – Create an empty N × N grid**  \n- Fill the whole grid with the background colour 0.  \n\n**Step 4 – Place the starting dots on the bottom row**  \n- For every recorded pair *(c, v)*: put colour *v* in cell *(row = N‑1, col = c)* of the new grid.  \n\n**Step 5 – Draw the diagonal for each dot**  \n- For each dot just placed:  \n  - LOOK at the cell’s current coordinates *(r, c)* (initially *r = N‑1*).  \n  - WHILE *r > 0* **and** *c < N‑1*:  \n    - SET *r ← r‑1*, *c ← c+1* (move one step up and one step right).  \n    - COLOR cell *(r, c)* with the dot’s colour *v*.  \n  - STOP when the next step would leave the grid.  \n\n**Step 6 – Verify**  \n- CHECK that every colour that was in the input now appears on the bottom row of the output in the same column.  \n- CHECK that for each of those colours there is a continuous line of the same colour moving up‑right until the top or right border, and that no other cells are coloured.  \n\nIf all checks pass, the transformation is complete.",
  "ff28f65a": "**Rule (explained like a child)**  \n1. Look at the big picture and find every little red square that is exactly 2 × 2 cells big (colour 2).  \n2. Count how many of those red squares you see.  \n3. Take a fresh tiny picture that is always 3 × 3 cells and fill it with the background colour 0.  \n4. There is a **fixed list of places** on this tiny picture, written in the order  \n\n```\ntop‑left,   top‑right,   centre,\nbottom‑left, bottom‑right,\ntop‑middle, middle‑left, middle‑right, bottom‑middle\n```\n\n5. Starting with the first red square you found, paint a blue dot (colour 1) on the first place of the list.  \n   For the second red square paint a blue dot on the second place, and so on.  \n6. If there are fewer red squares than places, the remaining cells stay background 0.  \n7. If several red squares would want the same place, the colour stays a single blue dot – it does not get brighter.\n\nThe result is the 3 × 3 grid that the task asks for.\n\n*Illustration of the concept*\n\n```\nBig picture (showing two 2×2 red blocks)\n+---+---+---+---+\n|22 |   |   |   |\n|22 |   |   |   |\n+---+---+---+---+\n|   |   |22 |22 |\n|   |   |22 |22 |\n+---+---+---+---+\n\nTiny 3×3 picture (places are filled in order)\nBefore:          After after two blocks:\n0 0 0            1 1 0   <-- first block → top‑left,\n0 0 0            0 0 0        second block → top‑right\n0 0 0\n```\n\n**Application Strategy:**\n**Step‑by‑step plan (LOOK → DO → CHECK)**  \n\n1. **LOOK:** Scan the whole input grid row by row, left to right, and whenever you see a cell of colour 2 whose right‑hand neighbour, lower neighbour and lower‑right neighbour are also colour 2, you have found a 2 × 2 red block.  \n   **DO:** For each such block record its *order* (first found, second found, …).  \n   **CHECK:** Make sure the four cells really form a solid 2 × 2 of colour 2 and that blocks do not overlap – the training data guarantees they are isolated.\n\n2. **LOOK:** Create a new 3 × 3 numpy array `out = np.zeros((3,3), dtype=int)` (background 0).  \n   **DO:** Prepare the ordered list of target positions:  \n\n```python\norder = [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2),\n         (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]\n```  \n\n   **CHECK:** The list contains nine distinct coordinates, exactly the order described above.\n\n3. **LOOK:** For the *i‑th* recorded red block (i starting at 0).  \n   **DO:** Take the i‑th pair from `order` and set `out[row, col] = 1`.  \n   **CHECK:** If `i` becomes larger than 8 there is no place left – this never happens in the given data.\n\n4. **LOOK:** After all blocks have been processed, examine `out`.  \n   **DO:** No further changes are needed; cells that were never addressed stay 0.  \n   **CHECK:** The number of 1’s in `out` equals the number of red 2 × 2 blocks you counted, and their positions follow the fixed order.\n\n5. **OUTPUT:** Return `out` as the final 3 × 3 grid."
